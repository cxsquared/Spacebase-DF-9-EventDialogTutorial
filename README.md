# Spacebase-DF-9-EventDialogTutorial
A quick template for adding new event dialog sets to Spacebase DF-9. You can use this to create quick mods for the game.

After you've edited the init.lua file make sure to place JUST the init.lua file into a zip file and place that in your Spacebase DF-9 mods folder located in the same place as the Space.exe.
